## About the project

Who said working with your inner critic has to be heavy and serious? This project offers a playful and creative approach to exploring and transforming your inner critic.

Through activities like drawing, naming, animating, and even giving your inner critic a silly voice, this platform helps you build a new relationship with that critical voice. It’s not about silencing it but reimagining it in ways that encourage curiosity, humor, and self-kindness.

Whether you’re an adult, teen, or child, this project invites you to laugh more and transform inner battles into moments of creativity and growth.

## Why I Built This

I created this project because of my personal experiences with a harsh inner critic. I’ve struggled with self-doubt and negativity, and I know many others face similar challenges. This platform is my way of providing a helpful resource that feels approachable and enjoyable.

## Features

- **Thought Reflection**: Users can note down the thoughts of their inner critic and evaluate how true they feel.
- **Emotion Mapping**: Explore what emotion these thoughts generate and search for an image that represents the feeling (using Pixabay's API).
- **Critic Naming**: Assign a name to the inner critic and save it.
- **Critic Visualization**: Draw the inner critic and animate it using [Meta's Animated Drawings](https://sketch.metademolab.com/) (integrated via an iframe).
- **Voice Manipulation**: Record and modify the inner critic's voice with fun effects like "chipmunk" or "mountain troll."
- **Thought Animation**: Apply animations to the recorded thoughts, such as spinning them away or making them disappear.
