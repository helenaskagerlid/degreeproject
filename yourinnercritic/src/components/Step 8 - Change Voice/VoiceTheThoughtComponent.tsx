          You critic <strong>{innerCriticName}</strong> have been having some

          The thoughts in question: "Me, <strong>{innerCriticName}</strong>,
          have been thinking: '{criticalThoughts}'"
        </p>
        <p>
          Your next step is to record saying these words in a silly voice.
          Really imagine that it is the animated {innerCriticName} who is saying
          this, and give it an exaggerative type of voice that give you a fun
          time. The goal here is to make the words feel even more distant, but
          in a goofy way. Some inspiration of types of voices you can try out:
          American, swenglish, a not so impressed teenager, a cartoon
          character.. BONUS: After you have finished recording you can even try
          to add a fun chipmunk or mountaintroll effect!
        </p>
        <ChangeVoiceComponent />
        <p>
          Now the real question is, how do you feel about these old thoughts
          after seeing <strong>{innerCriticName}</strong> in some different
          ehrm... situations?
